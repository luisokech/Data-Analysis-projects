## Power BI
- **Patients Healthcare**: The goal of this Power BI healthcare project could be to analyze patient satisfaction, wait time efficiency, and departmental referral trends. By examining demographic factors such as age, gender, race, alongside patient satisfaction scores and wait times, the project can identify patterns and provide insights into improving healthcare access and operational efficiency. Additionally, exploring flagged administrative cases and their impact on patient experiences could help streamline hospital processes and enhance service delivery across different departments.
